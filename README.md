## General info
Mission Control was built on 10 years of research. For her dissertation my mom built a model on how apps for the autistic community should be developed and how the UI should have integrated prompts and be distraction free. And I thought it would be cool to take that knowledge and build an app that reduces stress and allows the user to take ownership of their life skills and we could use for Autism Possible which is something my mom and I have been working on in our free time to help my brother and others like him. 

Currently we have four availible features: P Tracker, Hamper, Visual Schedules, Wardrobe, and SMS Notifications.

I wanted to keep the app simple and consistent. So throughout the entire app suite I use one consistent UI element. A button that I call the Mission Launcher.

## Features

### Hamper
In Hamper all the user has to do to log the start and end of a laundry cycle is with a laundry launcher.

I added a timer for a visual prompt with the option to send an SMS reminder once the timer finishes.

The user can also reset the timer if needed or can end the laundry cycle to cancel the SMS reminder

### Wardrobe
In Wardrobe it first shows the weather and the get outfit launcher. When pressed, the launcher will then show a sample outfit that the user can use as a guide when selecting an outfit for the day.

### P Tracker
Period Tracker logs the end and start of a menstural cycle.

### Visual Schedules
Visual schedules are a core evidence based practice for autistic users. <!-- [link to infor]() --> It allows them to create guides that help them to achieve specific goals.

I also use this within the app to provide help if they get stuck while completing their mission by breaking down tasks into simple steps.

For example, in hamper, while a user is completing their laundry mission if they get stuck they can click the help icon which will take them to a list of visual schedules to help them complete their mission.

A user ot their care giver can update the schedules in the Visual schedule app

To-do list:
* SMS notification for menstural cycle starting
* SMS notification for restocking sanitary products.
* Allow users to add articles of clothing to wardrobe.
* Create a dashboard for health professionals, educators, and guardians to track and set goals, and update user settings.
